/**
 * The whole ZZP Garantie backend: forward `/api/*` to the wallet_connect server
 * with this relying party's API key attached.
 *
 * All the disclosure logic — which usecase to run, which attributes to ask for,
 * reading them back off the verification server's internal listener — lives in
 * wallet_connect, on the nb-wallet side. A relying party only has to keep its
 * API key off the browser, which is exactly what this proxy is for.
 *
 * It is deliberately a catch-all rather than a route per endpoint: the wallet
 * button calls `/api/create-session` (via `start-url`), polls
 * `/api/disclosure/sessions/…`, and finally reads `/api/disclosed-attributes`,
 * all same-origin, so a single pass-through covers the flow and stays correct
 * if the button adds a call.
